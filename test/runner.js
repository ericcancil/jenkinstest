Then there is this ridiculous backstory about his dad and stuff that would be *tolerable* if you like knew and were friends with this prick. As I was there to see magic and a hot douche bag doing it, the backstory was just pathetic. Oh, also ballet with rabbits. Couldn't make up it's mind if it was a ballet (which would have been cool), Magic (which would have been cool if it was like.. magic not illusions), or a diary of dips**t (which I guess could be considered comedy?).
